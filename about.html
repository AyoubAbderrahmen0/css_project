                    <p>Today, Tunisia is called upon to achieve intensive growth, based on the exploitation of technical progress, using technological advances in the various sectors of economic and industrial activities. The mastership of all technological advances and the improvement of the efficiencies of the various sectors cannot be carried out without the involvement of the engineer.<br>
                    The governorate of Sfax is renowned for its industrial frame of SMEs (more than 2,500 units employing more than 60,000 people), largely in industrial production. Industrial development, which is closely linked to the evolution of information technology, implies a need for formation in the field of engineering sciences and for reforms of teaching programs so that they are perfectly adequate with the evolution of this technology. It is therefore important that engineering formation must be adapted to best respond to these “new” roles that are now assigned to it.<br></p>

                    <p>The engineering study program, in Industrial Computer Engineering (GII) of ENET'Com, is part of the objective of meeting the needs of industrial companies, working in the manufacturing sectors, in terms of high-level versatile executives in the fields of computer engineering and industrial computing. The choice of this program is justified by the fact that knowledge in the computer, electrical and automatic fields constitute a background, common to many functions that are increasingly necessary and demanded by the industrial sector. The latter is forced to integrate new information and industrial technologies, which requires on its part the recruitment of personnel specialized in these fields and able to integrate the constant mutation of technology.<br>
                    The industrial computer engineering study program was inspired by the need for business skills in this discipline established in the industrial fabric, considering the following criteria:<br></p>
